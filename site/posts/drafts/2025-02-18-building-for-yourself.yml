My grandfather was 
* born in the US in 1907 to immigrant Irish parents
* never graduated high school
* worked for the telephone company for 40 years
* a great storyteller
and according to family legend
* at minimum, he independently invented long nose pliers

Maybe another time I'll eulogize him and dig into his influence on me, but something I saw important from the beginning.

My grandfather had an incredible workshop.

He was a man who worked with his hands, at Indiana Bell.  Starting off in sewers and on telephone lines, he learned about phones and networking from the perspective of the field man.  When he retired in the 1970's, he was essentially running a private phone network for RCA.  As a young boy, in his many stories, I never once heard him complain about what he couldn't achieve because of the world he was born into.  His stories were always around characters he'd grown up with (like the unbelievably named "Ed Querengasser") or unlikely turn of events.

I want to highlight that workshop specifically.  He'd raised 4 kids in a pretty modest house in the Irish ghetto on the east side of Indianapolis.  By the time I cam around, he had great basement with a wet bar, and that workshop.  The workshop was dominated by a heavy black workbench with what seemed like hundreds of drawers.  A wall of tools rose above it with shelves on either side holding jars and boxes of nails, screws, fasteners, and about anything you could need for a project.  There was a vice of indeterminate age, a tool sharpener, and table saw, and a much smaller workbench.

Having been largely apprenticed and self-taught, he must have known how important it was to learn how to use tools at an early age.  On any visit, it became a ritual to immediately head down to the workshop and make a little plane out of scrap wood, under his supervision, and later without his supervision.  I learned how to properly hammer, how to saw, how to measure, how to screw up and then improvise a fix.  

It was just what grandpa's place was when were kids and what we did when we went there. Now, though. Now I recognize what a valuable classroom that was.  
Here are some of the biggest things I learned from being allowed in that workshop
* How to use a bunch of simple tools
* What kinds of tools existed beyond my skills
* How my grandpa use those more complicated tools
* How he'd use creativity to come up with a project just by looking at a piece of scrap wood
* How he'd organize so many different things (the workshop was always orderly even if it was covered in sawdust sometimes)
* How to look at things for reuse (many of his boxes and jars were old plastic containers or jelly jars)
* How to build for yourself
